# Feature Specification: Scrum Framework Management System

**Feature Branch**: `001-scrum-framework`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build requirement from url https://goodagile.com/scrumprimer/scrumprimer20.pdf"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → PDF URL provided for Scrum Primer 2.0
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: Scrum roles, events, artifacts, rules from framework
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → User flow covers complete Scrum process lifecycle
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a** Scrum Team (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team)  
**I want** a comprehensive Scrum framework management system  
**So that** I can effectively implement and track Scrum processes according to the Scrum Guide principles

### Key User Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Product Backlog Management
**Given** I am a Product Owner  
**When** I need to manage the product backlog  
**Then** I can create, prioritize, and refine product backlog items with clear acceptance criteria

**Test Cases:**
- Create new product backlog item with title, description, acceptance criteria
- Prioritize backlog items using drag-and-drop or ranking
- Refine backlog items by adding details, estimates, and dependencies
- Archive or remove completed/obsolete backlog items

#### Scenario 2: Sprint Planning
**Given** I am part of a Scrum Team  
**When** I conduct sprint planning  
**Then** I can select backlog items for the sprint, define sprint goal, and create sprint backlog

**Test Cases:**
- Select product backlog items based on priority and team capacity
- Define and document sprint goal
- Break down selected items into tasks
- Estimate effort for sprint backlog items
- Validate sprint capacity against team velocity

#### Scenario 3: Daily Scrum Tracking
**Given** I am a Development Team member  
**When** I participate in daily scrums  
**Then** I can update progress, identify impediments, and coordinate with team members

**Test Cases:**
- Update task status (Not Started, In Progress, Done)
- Log impediments with descriptions and impact
- View team member updates and progress
- Track sprint burndown progress

#### Scenario 4: Sprint Review
**Given** I am a stakeholder or team member  
**When** conducting a sprint review  
**Then** I can demonstrate completed work and gather feedback

**Test Cases:**
- Mark user stories as done/not done
- Document feedback from stakeholders
- Update product backlog based on review outcomes
- Generate sprint review report

#### Scenario 5: Sprint Retrospective
**Given** I am a Scrum Team member  
**When** conducting a sprint retrospective  
**Then** I can identify improvements and create action items

**Test Cases:**
- Add items to What Went Well, What Could Improve, Action Items
- Vote on most important improvement areas
- Assign action items to team members
- Track action item completion across sprints
