## Architecture Decisions

### Domain Driven Design Architecture
**Decision**: Implement DDD with bounded contexts and clean architecture
**Rationale**: 
- Scrum framework has well-defined domain concepts and business rules
- Multiple bounded contexts align with Scrum artifacts and processes
- Rich domain model captures complex business logic effectively
- Separation of concerns improves maintainability and testability

**Bounded Context Identification**:
1. **Team Management**: Teams, users, roles, permissions
2. **Product Backlog**: Backlog items, prioritization, refinement
3. **Sprint Management**: Sprint planning, execution, tracking
4. **Event Management**: Scrum ceremonies, scheduling, participation

**DDD Benefits for ScrumOps**:
- Ubiquitous language aligned with Scrum terminology
- Domain services for complex business rules (velocity calculation, capacity planning)
- Rich domain entities with behavior (not just data containers)
- Domain events for loose coupling between contexts
- Clear boundaries preventing cross-cutting concerns

**Validation**: ✅ APPROVED - Perfect fit for complex business domain

### Application Architecture: Clean Architecture with DDD
**Layers**:
1. **Domain Layer** (`ScrumOps.Domain`): 
   - Bounded contexts with entities, value objects, domain services
   - Domain events and interfaces
   - Business rule enforcement
   - No external dependencies

2. **Application Layer** (`ScrumOps.Application`): 
   - Use cases (commands and queries) using CQRS pattern
   - Application services orchestrating domain operations
   - DTOs for data transfer
   - MediatR for request/response handling

3. **Infrastructure Layer** (`ScrumOps.Infrastructure`): 
   - EF Core implementations
   - Repository pattern implementations
   - External service integrations
   - Domain event dispatching

4. **Presentation Layer** (`ScrumOps.Api`, `ScrumOps.Web`): 
   - API controllers (thin orchestration)
   - Blazor components organized by bounded context
   - UI services and HTTP clients

**Benefits**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable business logic isolated in domain layer
- Technology-agnostic domain model
- Easy to maintain and extend
- Support for complex business scenarios

### Domain Model Design Principles
**Rich Domain Model**: Entities contain business logic, not just data
**Value Objects**: Immutable objects for domain concepts (Priority, StoryPoints, Velocity)
**Domain Services**: For business logic that doesn't belong to single entity
**Aggregate Roots**: Consistency boundaries (Team, Sprint, ProductBacklog)
**Domain Events**: For communication between bounded contexts

**Example Domain Entity**:
```csharp
public class Sprint : IAggregateRoot
{
    private readonly List<SprintBacklogItem> _backlogItems = new();
    private readonly List<IDomainEvent> _domainEvents = new();
    
    public SprintId Id { get; private set; }
    public TeamId TeamId { get; private set; }
    public SprintGoal Goal { get; private set; }
    public DateRange Duration { get; private set; }
    public SprintStatus Status { get; private set; }
    public Capacity Capacity { get; private set; }
    
    public IReadOnlyList<SprintBacklogItem> BacklogItems => _backlogItems.AsReadOnly();
    public IReadOnlyList<IDomainEvent> DomainEvents => _domainEvents.AsReadOnly();
    
    public void StartSprint()
    {
        if (Status != SprintStatus.Planning)
            throw new DomainException("Only planning sprints can be started");
            
        if (!_backlogItems.Any())
            throw new DomainException("Cannot start sprint without backlog items");
            
        Status = SprintStatus.Active;
        _domainEvents.Add(new SprintStartedEvent(Id, DateTime.UtcNow));
    }
    
    public void AddBacklogItem(ProductBacklogItemId itemId, StoryPoints estimate)
    {
        if (Status != SprintStatus.Planning)
            throw new DomainException("Can only add items during sprint planning");
            
        var totalEstimate = _backlogItems.Sum(bi => bi.Estimate.Value) + estimate.Value;
        if (totalEstimate > Capacity.MaxStoryPoints)
            throw new DomainException("Adding item would exceed sprint capacity");
            
        var sprintBacklogItem = new SprintBacklogItem(itemId, estimate);
        _backlogItems.Add(sprintBacklogItem);
        
        _domainEvents.Add(new ItemAddedToSprintEvent(Id, itemId));
    }
}
```

### API Design: RESTful with OpenAPI
**REST Principles**:
- Resource-based URLs (`/api/teams/{id}/sprints`)
- HTTP verbs for actions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Status codes for response indication
- Stateless communication

**OpenAPI Integration**:
- Automatic documentation generation
- Request/response validation
- Type-safe client generation
- Interactive API explorer (Swagger UI)

### Security Model: Role-Based Access Control
**Authentication**: ASP.NET Core Identity (future enhancement)
**Authorization**: Policy-based authorization with custom requirements
**API Security**: JWT tokens for stateless authentication

**Scrum Role Mapping**:
- Product Owner: Full backlog management, sprint planning participation
- Scrum Master: Process facilitation, impediment management, team metrics
- Development Team: Task updates, sprint participation, limited backlog access

### Performance Optimization Strategy
**Database Performance**:
- Proper indexing strategy for queries
- Use of Include() for related data loading
- Pagination for large result sets
- Query optimization with EF Core query analysis

**API Performance**:
- Response caching for read-heavy endpoints
- Compression middleware for large payloads
- Async/await throughout the stack
- Connection pooling for database access

**Frontend Performance**:
- Component virtualization for large lists
- Lazy loading of components
- Efficient state management
- Progressive enhancement patterns

**Risk**: Docker environment complexity for new developers
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive setup documentation, test scripts, automated environment validation

**Risk**: Blazor Server scalability with many users
**Mitigation**: SignalR backplane configuration, monitoring connection counts

**Risk**: Entity Framework performance with complex queries

## Next Steps: Phase 1 Design

**Immediate Actions**:
