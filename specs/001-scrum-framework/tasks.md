# Tasks: Scrum Framework Management System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-scrum-framework/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/ ✅, quickstart.md ✅

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Tech stack: C# .NET 8.0, ASP.NET Core, Blazor, EF Core, PostgreSQL, Docker
   → Architecture: Domain Driven Design with Clean Architecture
2. Load design documents ✅
   → data-model.md: 4 bounded contexts, domain entities and value objects
   → contracts/: Teams, Sprints, Backlog API endpoints  
   → research.md: Technology decisions and DDD patterns
   → quickstart.md: Development setup and testing procedures
3. Generate tasks by category ✅
   → Setup: project structure, dependencies, DDD infrastructure
   → Tests: contract tests, domain tests, integration tests  
   → Core: domain entities, application services, API controllers
   → Integration: EF Core setup, database, API middleware
   → Polish: UI components, documentation, performance
4. Apply task rules ✅
   → Different bounded contexts = parallel [P]
   → Same aggregate/files = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...) ✅
6. Dependencies and parallel execution defined ✅
```

## Dependencies

**Phase Dependencies**:
- Setup (T001-T005) → Tests (T006-T015) → Domain (T016-T038) → Application (T039-T057) → Infrastructure (T058-T069) → API (T070-T075) → UI (T076-T090) → Polish (T091-T102)

**Key Blocking Relationships**:
- T004 (Shared Kernel) blocks all domain entities (T016-T038)
- T039-T041 (Application Infrastructure) blocks all use cases (T043-T057)
- T058 (DbContext) blocks all repository implementations (T063-T066)
- T067-T069 (Database setup) blocks all API controllers (T070-T072)
- T070-T072 (API controllers) blocks UI HTTP services (T090)

**Bounded Context Independence**:
- Team Management: T020-T024, T043-T047, T059, T063, T079-T081
- Product Backlog: T025-T029, T048-T052, T060, T064, T082-T084  
- Sprint Management: T030-T034, T053-T057, T061, T065, T085-T087
- Event Management: T035-T038, T062, T066

## Parallel Execution Examples

**Phase 3.2 - All domain tests together**:
```bash
Task: "Team aggregate domain tests in tests/ScrumOps.Domain.Tests/TeamManagement/TeamTests.cs"
Task: "ProductBacklog aggregate domain tests in tests/ScrumOps.Domain.Tests/ProductBacklog/ProductBacklogTests.cs"
Task: "Sprint aggregate domain tests in tests/ScrumOps.Domain.Tests/SprintManagement/SprintTests.cs"
Task: "Value objects validation tests in tests/ScrumOps.Domain.Tests/SharedKernel/ValueObjectTests.cs"
```

**Phase 3.3 - Bounded contexts in parallel**:
```bash
Task: "Team aggregate root in src/ScrumOps.Domain/TeamManagement/Entities/Team.cs"
Task: "ProductBacklog aggregate root in src/ScrumOps.Domain/ProductBacklog/Entities/ProductBacklog.cs"
Task: "Sprint aggregate root in src/ScrumOps.Domain/SprintManagement/Entities/Sprint.cs"
Task: "SprintEvent aggregate root in src/ScrumOps.Domain/EventManagement/Entities/SprintEvent.cs"
```

**Phase 3.7 - UI components by context**:
```bash
Task: "Team list component in src/ScrumOps.Web/Components/TeamManagement/TeamListComponent.razor"
Task: "Backlog list component in src/ScrumOps.Web/Components/ProductBacklog/BacklogListComponent.razor"
Task: "Sprint dashboard component in src/ScrumOps.Web/Components/SprintManagement/SprintDashboardComponent.razor"
```

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files/bounded contexts, no dependencies
- **Verify tests fail** before implementing (TDD approach)
- **Commit after each task** for better tracking
- **Domain Driven Design**: Maintain bounded context boundaries
- **Clean Architecture**: Respect layer dependencies (Domain ← Application ← Infrastructure/API/Web)

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All API contracts (teams, sprints, backlog) have corresponding tests (partial - teams done)
- [x] All domain entities have comprehensive domain tests  
- [x] All tests come before implementation (TDD approach)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different bounded contexts/files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] DDD principles maintained throughout task organization
- [x] Clean Architecture layers respected in dependencies
- [x] Constitutional requirements (testing, code quality, performance) addressed
