#### üìà Metrics Collection
- **Application Metrics**: Request rates, error rates, response times (p50, p95, p99)
- **Business Metrics**: Sprint completion rates, team velocity, backlog progress
- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, and runtime performance via OpenTelemetry
- **Prometheus Format**: Industry-standard metrics export for monitoring systems

#### üîó Distributed Tracing
- **Request Tracing**: End-to-end request flow across services
- **Database Instrumentation**: Entity Framework Core query tracing
- **W3C Standards**: Trace context propagation following industry standards
- **Sampling**: Intelligent sampling (100% dev, 10% prod) for performance

### Monitoring Dashboards

Access comprehensive monitoring through Grafana dashboards:
- **ScrumOps Overview**: Key performance indicators and system health
- **HTTP Metrics**: Request rates, error rates, and latency percentiles
- **Business Intelligence**: Team performance and sprint analytics
- **Custom Alerts**: Configurable alerts for critical system events

### Performance Targets
- **< 5% Overhead**: Minimal performance impact from observability
- **< 200ms API Response**: 95th percentile response time target
- **99.9% Uptime**: High availability monitoring and alerting
- **Real-time Insights**: Live dashboards for immediate issue detection
