# ScrumOps Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code MUST meet these non-negotiable quality standards:
- **Clean Code**: Functions < 20 lines, classes < 300 lines, cyclomatic complexity < 10
- **Documentation**: Every public API documented with examples, inline comments for complex logic only
- **Code Review**: All changes require peer review; no direct commits to main branch
- **Static Analysis**: Code MUST pass linting, security scanning, and dependency vulnerability checks
- **Naming Standards**: Self-documenting names; no abbreviations except industry standard (e.g., API, URL, JSON)

*Rationale: Consistent quality standards reduce technical debt and improve maintainability*

### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Testing discipline MUST be maintained at all levels:
- **TDD Mandatory**: Tests written before implementation; Red-Green-Refactor cycle enforced
- **Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% code coverage; 100% for critical business logic
- **Test Types**: Unit tests (fast, isolated), integration tests (API contracts), end-to-end tests (critical user flows)
- **Test Quality**: Tests MUST be readable, maintainable, and test behavior not implementation
- **Failure Policy**: Failing tests block all deployments; no exceptions

*Rationale: Test-first development ensures reliable, maintainable code and prevents regression*

### III. User Experience Consistency
User interface and interaction patterns MUST be consistent:
- **Design System**: All UI components follow established design system patterns
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory; keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach; tested on mobile, tablet, desktop viewports
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error messages, graceful degradation, user-friendly feedback
- **Performance UX**: Loading states, progress indicators, optimistic updates where appropriate

*Rationale: Consistent UX reduces cognitive load and improves user satisfaction*

### IV. Performance Requirements
System performance MUST meet these benchmarks:
- **Response Times**: API responses < 200ms (p95), page loads < 2s, critical actions < 500ms
- **Scalability**: Handle 10x current load without degradation
- **Resource Usage**: Memory usage stable, no memory leaks, CPU usage optimized
- **Monitoring**: All performance metrics tracked, alerts configured for SLA violations
- **Optimization**: Performance testing required for all user-facing features

*Rationale: Performance directly impacts user experience and business outcomes*

### V. Observability and Monitoring
System behavior MUST be observable and traceable:
- **Structured Logging**: JSON format, consistent log levels, correlation IDs for request tracing
- **Metrics Collection**: Business metrics, technical metrics, SLA tracking
- **Error Tracking**: All errors logged with context, grouped by type, alerting configured
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health endpoints for all services
- **Documentation**: Runbooks for common issues, monitoring dashboards for key metrics

*Rationale: Observability enables rapid issue detection, debugging, and system understanding*

## Code Quality Standards

### Static Analysis Requirements
- **Linting**: ESLint, Prettier, or equivalent for all languages
- **Security**: SAST tools integrated in CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependencies**: Automated vulnerability scanning, license compliance checking  
- **Code Complexity**: Automated complexity analysis, violations block merges
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing where available (TypeScript, etc.)

### Code Organization
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns, dependency injection
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific configs, secrets management
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error types, proper exception handling, no swallowed errors
- **Logging Standards**: Structured logs, appropriate log levels, no sensitive data in logs

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- **Main Branch**: Always deployable, protected with required checks
- **Feature Branches**: Short-lived, named with ticket numbers (e.g., `123-feature-name`)
- **Pull Requests**: Required for all changes, squash and merge strategy
- **Release Process**: Automated versioning, changelog generation, rollback procedures

### Quality Gates
- **Pre-commit**: Linting, basic tests, secret scanning
- **CI Pipeline**: Full test suite, security scans, build verification
- **Code Review**: Architecture review, test coverage review, security review
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment with health checks, monitoring validation

### Review Process
- **Review Requirements**: At least one approved review, all conversations resolved
- **Review Scope**: Code quality, test coverage, architecture alignment, security considerations
- **Documentation**: README updates, API documentation, changelog entries as needed

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and policies. All team members MUST:
- Follow these principles without exception
- Raise violations immediately during code review
- Propose amendments through formal RFC process
- Justify any complexity additions against simplicity principle

**Amendment Process**: 
1. RFC document with rationale and impact analysis
2. Team review and approval (consensus required)
3. Migration plan for existing code if needed
4. Constitution version update and communication

**Compliance Monitoring**:
- Regular architecture reviews against principles
- Automated checks in CI/CD pipeline where possible
- Quarterly constitution review meetings
- Metrics tracking for principle adherence
